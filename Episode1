## 🟡 **SCENE 1 – Sunny Meadow Music Picnic**

**LTX-2 Prompt:**

> A bright, cheerful outdoor meadow under a clear blue sky with soft white clouds. Rounded cartoon trees with pastel green foliage surround a colorful picnic blanket. Ullie, a fluffy white bichon frise with big expressive eyes and a pink bandana, sits happily at the center. Mila the French bulldog, Teddy the corgi, Luna the brown lab–husky mix, and Gus the English cocker spaniel gather around him. Simple toy instruments like a drum, bells, and a xylophone rest on the blanket. Warm sunlight, soft shadows, high-saturation pastel colors, smooth 3D CGI animation with rounded shapes and no fur texture. The dogs smile and wag their tails as they prepare for a friendly music picnic, playful and calm preschool atmosphere.

The environment remains bright and safe, with pastel colors and rounded scenery. The mood is gentle mystery, not scary, encouraging listening and curiosity. Soft lighting, smooth Pixar-lite 3D style, large expressive eyes, comforting preschool tone.
