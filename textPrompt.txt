A lullaby video for our star Starry Lullaby Lane Channel. It is disney style cartoon video with the following lyrics.
it should be 10 sec long.


Hush now, little dreamer, the night’s tucked you in,
The moon’s hanging softly, the stars all grin.
Lanterns glow golden down a quiet lane,
It’s time to rest easy on Lullaby Lane.

Close your eyes, take a breath,
Let the day drift away,
Starry’s watching over you,
Till the light of the day.

Twinkle, twinkle, drift and sway,
Sleepy stars will light your way.
Safe and warm, no need to roam,
Starry Lullaby Lane is home.

Clouds hum a tune as they float on by,
Lambs count softly beneath the sky.
Owls whisper stories, gentle and slow,
Dreams are waiting, it’s time to go.

Stretch and yawn, feel the calm,
Let your worries fly,
Every dream is wrapped in love,
As the night drifts by.

Twinkle, twinkle, drift and sway,
Sleepy stars will light your way.
Safe and warm, no need to roam,
Starry Lullaby Lane is home.

Shhh… the world is sleeping now,
Every wish is safe somehow.
Hold your dream and snuggle tight,
Starry’s here all through the night.

Twinkle, twinkle, drifting slow,
Feel the peaceful moonlight glow.
Close your eyes, you’re not alone,
Starry Lullaby Lane… is home.

Goodnight, little star. Sweet dreams.
